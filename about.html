<h2>What We Do:</h2>
<h4>A Dog's Brew is devoted to all dog lovers out there. We want to make our coffie shop as welcoming as possible to dogs. Think of this as a reward for man's best friend by serving them along with you!</h4>
<hr>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
<h4>We have no complex rules regarding dogs, as this place is made for them! We only have two rules overall.</h4>
<h4>1. <b>NO CATS ALLOWED</b> </h4>
<h4>We have found it obvious about now, but Cats and Dogs do not mix well in the same place together. So you can't bring a cat into the resturant. And don't try to disguise it as a dog either! That will only end in  a disaster.</h4>
<h4>2. Have a normal dog for pete's sake!</h4>
    <h4>We never thought we would have to make that rule until that <b><i>ONE</i></b> family and their dog showed up. So as long as you are not any of them, or at least have a good dog, you can come.</h4>
